## Description

Implement proper handling and messaging when users attempt to sign up with an email address that already exists in the system. This should provide clear guidance to existing users while maintaining security best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Duplicate email attempts show clear messaging
- [ ] Users are guided to sign-in instead of sign-up
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal whether email exists for security
- [ ] Appropriate suggestions are provided (password reset
- [ ] sign-in)
- [ ] Handling works consistently with Supabase auth responses
- [ ] User experience remains smooth when email already exists
