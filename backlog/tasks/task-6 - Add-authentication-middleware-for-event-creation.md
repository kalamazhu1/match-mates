## Description

Implement authentication middleware to protect the /events/create route and API endpoint, ensuring only authenticated users can access event creation functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
- [ ] Authentication middleware validates user sessions
- [ ] API endpoint verifies user authentication before processing
- [ ] Proper error messages for authentication failures
- [ ] User session data is available in event creation context
