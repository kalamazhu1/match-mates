# Manual Authentication Flow Testing Checklist
**Task-55: Validate complete authentication flow end-to-end**

## Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Application is running locally (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Database is connected and schema is deployed
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Clear browser cache and localStorage

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Complete User Journey Testing

#### A. Signup Flow
- [ ] Navigate to `/auth/signup`
- [ ] Verify signup form loads properly
- [ ] Fill all required fields:
  - [ ] Email: Use a unique test email
  - [ ] Password: Strong password (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)
  - [ ] Confirm Password: Match original password
  - [ ] Full Name: Valid name
  - [ ] Phone: Valid phone number (optional)
  - [ ] NTRP Level: Select from dropdown
  - [ ] Terms: Accept terms and conditions
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Verify success page or email verification message appears
- [ ] Check database: User record created in `auth.users` table
- [ ] Check database: Profile record created in `public.users` table

#### B. Email Verification Flow (if applicable)
- [ ] Check email for verification link
- [ ] Click verification link
- [ ] Verify redirect to success page or signin
- [ ] Check database: `email_confirmed_at` is set

#### C. Signin Flow
- [ ] Navigate to `/auth/signin`
- [ ] Verify signin form loads properly
- [ ] Enter test email and password
- [ ] Optional: Test "Remember me" checkbox
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Verify successful redirect to dashboard
- [ ] Check: User profile information displays correctly

#### D. Dashboard Access
- [ ] User name/email displays correctly
- [ ] Profile information card shows all user data
- [ ] NTRP level displays correctly
- [ ] Phone number displays if provided
- [ ] Member since date is correct
- [ ] Quick action buttons are present and functional

### 2. Session & State Management Testing

#### A. Session Persistence
- [ ] Refresh page - user remains logged in
- [ ] Navigate between pages - authentication state maintained
- [ ] Close and reopen browser tab - session persists (if "Remember me" was checked)
- [ ] Open new browser tab - user is automatically signed in

#### B. Authentication Context Testing
- [ ] AuthContext provides correct user data across all components
- [ ] Profile data updates reflect immediately across all components
- [ ] Loading states show appropriately during auth checks
- [ ] Auth state changes trigger appropriate UI updates

### 3. Protected Route Testing

#### A. Access Control
- [ ] Unauthenticated access to `/dashboard` redirects to signin
- [ ] Unauthenticated access to `/profile` redirects to signin
- [ ] Unauthenticated access to `/events/create` redirects to signin
- [ ] After signin, user is redirected to originally requested page

#### B. ProtectedRoute Component
- [ ] Loading fallback displays during authentication check
- [ ] Correct redirect behavior for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Proper handling of users without complete profiles

### 4. Cross-Component Integration Testing

#### A. Header Component
- [ ] Shows "Sign In" and "Sign Up" links when unauthenticated
- [ ] Shows user profile info and "Sign Out" when authenticated
- [ ] Navigation links work correctly in both states

#### B. Navigation Behavior
- [ ] Authenticated users can access all protected areas
- [ ] Navigation maintains authentication state
- [ ] Breadcrumbs and active states work correctly

### 5. Database Integration Testing

#### A. User Profile Creation
- [ ] Signup creates both auth user and profile record
- [ ] Profile data matches form submission exactly
- [ ] Timestamps are set correctly (created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are established correctly

#### B. Profile Data Retrieval
- [ ] Signin fetches complete profile data
- [ ] Profile data displays correctly in all UI components
- [ ] Profile updates (if implemented) sync with database
- [ ] Concurrent user sessions handle data consistently

### 6. Error Scenario Testing

#### A. Signup Errors
- [ ] Duplicate email shows appropriate error message
- [ ] Weak password shows validation error
- [ ] Missing required fields show validation errors
- [ ] Password mismatch shows error
- [ ] Invalid email format shows error
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully

#### B. Signin Errors
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error message
- [ ] Unverified email shows verification prompt
- [ ] Rate limiting shows appropriate message
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully

#### C. Session Errors
- [ ] Expired sessions redirect to signin appropriately
- [ ] Network disconnection handles gracefully
- [ ] Malformed tokens are handled properly

### 7. Sign Out Testing
- [ ] Sign out button/link is visible when authenticated
- [ ] Clicking sign out clears authentication state
- [ ] After sign out, protected routes redirect to signin
- [ ] Session storage/cookies are cleared properly
- [ ] User cannot access protected routes after signout

### 8. Browser Compatibility Testing
- [ ] Chrome: All functionality works
- [ ] Firefox: All functionality works  
- [ ] Safari: All functionality works
- [ ] Edge: All functionality works
- [ ] Mobile browsers: Responsive design and functionality

### 9. Performance & UX Testing
- [ ] Authentication checks don't cause visible delays
- [ ] Loading states provide good user experience
- [ ] Form submissions are responsive
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Success flows provide clear feedback

### 10. Security Testing
- [ ] Passwords are not visible in network requests
- [ ] JWT tokens are not exposed in console/localStorage inappropriately  
- [ ] Session cookies have appropriate security flags
- [ ] CSRF protection is implemented
- [ ] XSS protection is in place

## Test Data Clean-up
- [ ] Remove test user accounts from database
- [ ] Clear any test data created during testing
- [ ] Reset any modified configuration

## Test Results Documentation
Record results for each test scenario:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Feature works as expected
- ‚ùå FAIL: Feature has issues (document details)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Feature works but has minor issues
- üö´ BLOCKED: Cannot test due to dependencies
